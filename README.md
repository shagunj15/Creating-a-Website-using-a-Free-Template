# Creating-a-Website-using-a-Free-Template
<br>
Check out my site that I made using a free template from www.mashup-template.com : <br>

You can always make your own website using HTML and CSS. For example, take a look at this site:<br>
https://shagunj15.github.io/startup-landing-page/ <br><br>
But what a lot of people don't know is that there are many templates available online. On sites like http://www.mashup-template.com/templates.html and https://www.creative-tim.com/, you can find templates, some of them you might have to pay for but many are free, of different type of designs. Whether you are making a blog or an ecommerce site, you can find many different designs and choose which design you want and download the related css, HTML, and javascript files. <br>
Of course, after that all you have to do is modify these files to make your website your own.
