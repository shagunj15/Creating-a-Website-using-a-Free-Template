# Creating-a-Website-using-a-Free-Template
<br>
Check out my site that I made using a free template from www.mashup-template.com : <br>

You can always make your own website using HTML and CSS. For example, take a look at this site:<br>
https://shagunj15.github.io/startup-landing-page/ <br><br>
But what a lot of people don't know is that there are many templates available online. On sites like http://www.mashup-template.com/templates.html and https://www.creative-tim.com/, you can find templates, some of them you might have to pay for but many are free, of different type of designs. Whether you are making a blog or an ecommerce site, you can find many different designs and choose which design you want and download the related css, HTML, and javascript files. <br><br>

Of course, after that all you have to do is modify these files to make your website your own. For example, my aim was to make a blog. Hence, I designed my logo and replaced the original 'mashup-template' logo present on the teplate. After that I added my own images and changed the layout of some of the images which could be done by looking at the css file. I also changed the header and footer to make it more to my style and of course added my urls wherever necessary. <br><br>

The template that I downloaded had six HTML files, one CSS file and one JavaScript file. These are the only files that you would have to modify. To change the images, you will have to add your images to the "asset" folder and put the href of the image into the different HTML files. To change the layout, which could even include somehting simple as adding margins or padding, look at the classes and then go to that specific class in the css file and make your changes. For making changes in how a function works, you'll have to go into the JS file.<br><br>

It is important to note that these templates are not dynamic HTML pages. This means that when I make certain changes in one HTML file, those changes have to be made again on the other HTML files. For example, in my header, I wanted to get rid of the "services" heading in my nav. I removed it on the 'Home' page but I had to do this again in my other pages, i.e, my 'About', 'Contact' etc. pages. <br>
To get rid of this issue, pages need to be made dynamic which can be done by using React.js or Vue.js.
